IOC_L_App9:

	Concept Covered:
	
			1. Java Based Configuration:
			
				Java-based configuration option enables us to write most of your Spring configuration without XML but with the
				help of few Java-based annotations.
			
			2. Logging using Jakarta Commons Logging (JCL) API. (EmployeeDemoImpl.java)		


Note:

	1. @Configuration indicates that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions.
	2. @Bean annotation tells Spring that a method annotated with @Bean will return an object that should be registered 
	   as a bean in the Spring application context.
	3. @Import annotation allows for loading @Bean definitions from another configuration class.
	
		e.g:
		
			@Configuration
			public class ConfigA {
			   @Bean
			   public A a() {
			      return new A(); 
			   }
			}
			
			Uses of @Import:
			
			@Configuration
			@Import(ConfigA.class)
			public class ConfigB {
			   @Bean
			   public B a() {
			      return new A(); 
			   }
			}

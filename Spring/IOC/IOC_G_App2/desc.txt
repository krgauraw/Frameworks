IOC_G_App2: Lazy Loading or Pre Loading of Bean. (L11)

Pre Loading: 

	ApplicationContext loads all bean having singleton scope at server startup time whereas BeanFactory load beans
	on request only (always lazy loading).
	For beans having prototype scope, ApplicationContext & BeanFactory both works same. beans will be loaded upon request
	only.

Lazy Loading:

	In ApplicationContext, we can configure lazy loading for beans having singleton scope by providing 
	one attribute lazy-init="true" in bean definition.
	BeanFactory support for Lazy Loading by default. So no question for configuring lazy loading property.
